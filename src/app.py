"""
Dash App Module for Interactive Economy Simulator

This module initializes and configures the Dash web application
for the Economy Simulator project.

It sets up the app layout and registers callbacks, then exposes
the WSGI server for deployment (e.g., with Gunicorn). When run
directly, it starts the development server.
